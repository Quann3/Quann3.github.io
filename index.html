<h1>About The Artist </h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;" class="lead font-weight-bold">	Marquan is an artist from the East Bay who creates art out of Photography,Visuals and Fashion. He's been obsessed with the medium of art since he was just about 8 years old from watching his sisters make YouTube videos. As he's gotten older he's started to develop a love for fashion and photography and even fashion and even had thought of going to art school or maybe even fashion school but decided to do that on his own. In his Portfolio, He will be showing his work from his "Intro To Digital Media Class" here at SJSU. Some of the works include: Glitch, Meme, Photoshop/illustrator and his Net art assignment. I hope you enjoy his work and maybe someday can become just like him :). </p
